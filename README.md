# 🖥️ IT Projects & Labs – Real-World Problem Solving

This repository contains IT projects designed to simulate real-world workplace tasks. Each lab solves a practical IT problem, includes step-by-step solutions, and is aligned to real job responsibilities in IT support, systems administration, and infrastructure roles.


## 📘 Project Categories
